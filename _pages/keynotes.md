**The effacement of information technology from EU law: the need for collaborative approaches to redesign the EU’s regulatory architecture**

**Abstract:** EU information technology law is built like a multi-storey house: on the ground floor is technology development and on the top floor are regulatory principles and rights; in the middle floor lie standards, which should connect the top with the ground floor. The house is built on the premise that these floors are seamlessly connected, but are they? The multi-storey house was in fact built without staircases, causing a practical disconnect between regulatory principles and technology development. In this talk, which draws from the 2023 book ‘Cybersecurity, Privacy and Data Protection in EU law’, we will explore why information technology is effaced from EU law in practice, and the implications for cybersecurity, data protection, data markets, identity management, privacy and many other fields. We will explore what collaborative approaches may be needed to redesign the EU regulatory architecture.

**On the endeavour designing and deploying a privacy certification scheme under the GDPR**

**Abstract:** The talk will shortly sketch the genesis of a certification scheme. First, it will introduce the concept of GDPR certification under Art 42 /43 GDPR. Then it will reflect on the initial research challenges and the resulting research projects which lead to the development of lean sketch of a certification scheme. Some focus will be taken on the various technological obstacles on the way. The second half of the talk will then tell the story from finished research project to a scheme that can be used in practice; including, the legal and organisational inhibitors.

**Stefan Schiffner** is lecturing Computer Networks and IT Security at BHH University of Applied Sciences Hamburg. He has been a post doctoral researcher at University of Luxembourg, an expert in information security at the European Union’s Cyber Security Agency (ENISA), and a post-doctoral researcher at TU Darmstadt, were he led a team of researchers on the topics of privacy and trust within the Telekooperation group. He holds a Ph.D. from KU Leuven (Topic: models for online privacy, trust and reputation) and the Degree of Diplom Informatiker from TU Dresden. His research interests focus on secure information technologies and their policy implications. This includes specifically Privacy Enhancing Technologies, computational trust, “by Design” Paradigms, and maturity and market readiness of technologies. A computer scientist by training, Stefan is an advocate for the free use of cryptographic techniques and anonymisation tools as means for individuals to exercise their right to privacy and freedom of speech.

**The Digital Services Act: New rules for online platforms and how to hold them accountable**

**Abstract:** The Digital Services Act is a legislative approach by the European Union to regulate (large) online platforms. It imposes a new set of roles regarding transparency, e.g. in content moderation or online advertising and mandates risk assessments and audits for those very large online platforms and search engines like Instagram, TikTok, Google or Zalando. They must assess the impact of their platforms, organizations and algorithms on systemic risks like election integrity or the mental health of its users.
In my talk, I will describe the idea of the DSA and its implications for researchers conducting studies on online platform data practices. I will draw examples from our research on TikTok and approaches to discuss methodologies for data-based platform research. 

**Martin Degeling** is a researcher at Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a berlin-based Think Tank for technology policy. Previously, he was a post-doctoral researcher at Ruhr-University Bochum and Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests are black-box auditing of algorithmic systems, usable privacy and security, and data protection.

**Privacy Is Hard And Seven Other Myths. Achieving Privacy Through Careful Design**

**Abstract:** In this talk Jaap-Henk Hoepman will discuss some of the myths
surrounding privacy (like "I have nothing to hide" and "We are not
collecting personal data" or "You have zero privacy anyway. Get over
it."). All to show that technological developments have had a tremendous
impact on our privacy, but also can be used to protect our privacy. He
will talk about the legal protection of privacy through the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), and discuss how relying on purely legal
measures is not enough. The systems themselves should be designed in a
privacy friendly manner, through privacy by design. He will explain the
privacy by design philosophy, and make it concrete by describing eight
privacy design strategies.

former scientific director and co-founder) of the Privacy & Identity Lab.

He studies privacy by design and privacy friendly protocols for identity
management and the Internet of Things. He speaks on these topics at
national and international congresses and publishes papers in
(inter)national journals. He also appears in the media as security and
privacy expert, and writes about his research in the popular press. He
is actively involved in the public debate concerning security and
privacy in our society.

In October 2021 his book Privacy Is Hard and Seven Other Myths.
Achieving Privacy through Careful Design appeared at MIT Press.

In his free time he enjoys making composing music, designing graphics,
cooking, and practising Okinawan Goju Ryu karate-do.

**Deploying privacy enhancing technologies in an e-government**

**Abstract:** Would it not be amazing if a country could build data-driven services based on the data of its population or organisations while preserving the privacy of the individuals and providing transparency on the processing? In this talk we will take a look at the possibilities that different privacy enhancing technologies offer by enabling different stakeholders to process data without seeing individual values. We look at issues that public sector organisations have with using PETs and issues that could be solved by PETs.
