Currently we are waiting for the following types of submissions:

1. Extended abstracts for papers: At least 2 and at most 4 pages; from these submissions, the PC chairs select papers in the scope of the call for presentation.
2. Proposals for workshops: Proposals should contain a 2-page statement summarising the topic(s) to be discussed and the expected contributions from the audience members, e.g. responding to a questionnaire or conducting a small experiment. Proposers should indicate whether any special equipment is needed for the workshop, such as audio-visual systems or computational equipment and support. The Chairs will get in contact if and how a workshop will fit in this years programme.
3. Proposals for tutorials: Proposals should contain a 2-page summary and state the level and background required for audience members to follow the tutorial. The Chairs will get in contact if and how a workshop will fit in this years programme.
