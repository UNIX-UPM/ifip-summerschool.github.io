## To be published soon...


## Why should I submit?

Accepted papers will receive thorough discussions during the School and provide students with an opportunity to be published in the IFIP AICT series by Springer. Students who present a paper can receive a course certificate. 

Course certificates for 1,5 or in total 3 ECTS at PhD level can be issued by Karlstad University:

- 1,5 ECTS will be awarded for participation in at least 80% of the program, and for the delivery of a 1000-words-essay on how own research is relevant in comparison with or can be inspired by the summer school sessions.

- Additional 1,5 ECTS will be awarded to students who in addition to delivering a pre-event abstract of their own research article,  pass a peer review of a full article based on feedback from the summer school that will be performed post-event.

We encourage submissions from students from emerging economies:Â it is possible to apply for support from the IFIP Digital Equity Fund to ease student travel.
