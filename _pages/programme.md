## Keynotes

**Os Keyes - Participation before Data: Historicising Trans Counterpower**
![](/assets/images/keynotes/os_keyes.png){: .align-left}

**Abstract:** In an era increasingly characterised by the hype around (and fear of) big data, notions of both participatory data practices and data counterpower are increasingly discussed. Both are valuable, but both are seen as relatively novel and untested. Are they? In this talk I will contextualise the idea of democratic data engagement and the use of data to "talk back" to those in power within the history of transgender ("trans") medicine. Demonstrating the long historic arc of these practices - an arc that starts before modern AI - I will discuss what lessons can be learned from the successes and failures of early digital trans activism.

**Os Keyes** ([Website](https://ironholds.org/)) is a researcher and writer at the University of Washington. Their work focuses on questions of gender, disability, technology and power, with a particular interest in machine learning, biomedicine and the intersection thereof. An inaugural Ada Lovelace Fellow, their work has been published in CSCW, CHI, *Cultural Studies* and a range of media venues, including *Vice, Wired* and *Logic* magazines.

**Welderufael** (aka Welde) is a Senior Researcher in information privacy and security at the Chair of Mobile Business & Multilateral Security at Goethe University Frankfurt am Main. He holds a Ph.D. degree in computer science from Goethe University Frankfurt, a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering with specialization in Mobile Systems from Luleå University of Technology, and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from  Mekelle Institute of Technology (MIT-Tigray). His research lays at the 'symbiosis' of user-centric approaches to information privacy protection, data protection regulations (e.g., the EU GDPR), and applied machine learning & NLP techniques. He endeavors to design and develop "intelligent" tools that empower the user in making informed privacy-related decisions regarding sensitive information disclosures by also taking the user’s regulatory rights into account. Additionally, since 2013, he has been working in various security and privacy related projects funded by the European Commission.

**Christian Buggedei - How to build organisations for privacy-friendly solutions**
![](/assets/images/keynotes/c_buggedei.jpg){: .align-left}

**Abstract:** One of the key challenges is to manage the different stakeholders: There Private citizens who don't want to have their privacy compromised. Then there are corporations that rely on access to that same data for their business models. And there is society, represented by governments and regulators, with their own overarching needs and interests.
polypoly has split up into three independent entities: A citizen-owned cooperative, a corporation, and a foundation.
Christian Buggedei explains the vision of polypoly and how this split ensures that everyones interests are fairly represented.

**Christian Buggedei** has more than 20 years of IT experience across all industries from the plumbing business around the corner to large public institutions. He is currently Product Owner at polypoly, a cooperative for all European citizens working on a new infrastructure for the data economy.
