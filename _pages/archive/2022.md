# Call For Papers

## Participation in a digital society

The **17th IFIP Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management** takes a holistic approach to society and technology, supporting interdisciplinary research exchange through keynote lectures, tutorials, workshops, and paper presentations.

In particular, we welcome contributions combining any of the following perspectives: anthropological, economic, ethical, historical, legal, media & communication, regulatory, sociological, critical, surveillance, technical, philosophical, disabilites, political, and psychological studies.

The IFIP Summer School encourages not only interdisciplinary but also broader diversity. It particularly welcomes submissions on how to foster gender and cultural balance in privacy research and policy, and notably tutorials and workshops about how to raise awareness in these matters.

## Theme

Digital technology has become part of the everyday practices of the majority of people all around the world. Participation in practices that involve digital systems allows people to benefit from the various advantages they provide. However, with moving traditional processes online, this digital participation often becomes inevitable, since there are in some cases only limited options to access services without using digital tools. This poses major challenges with respect to user privacy and the control over personal information. Also, populations are highly diverse, which is not always taken into consideration for technology and data practices. This often leads to more adverse effects on People of Color and queer, especially trans, people. People also differ in age and ability, with an increasing aging population, there is large mobility between cultures and countries, and there is now the generally accepted demand that as many people in a society as possible should be able to participate in its activities, including people with physical, sensory, cognitive or psychological limitations. This creates challenges in the design of digital systems, not least in aspects related to privacy and identity management. This also includes participation in design processes. The discussion of these issues in the context of privacy is just beginning, and the summer school aims to create a platform for creating awareness and facilitating interactions and knowledge exchanges around these issues.

## Four-phase review process

The research paper presentations and the workshops focus on involving students, and on encouraging the publication of high-quality, thorough research papers by students and young researchers. To this end, the School will have a four-phase review process for submitted papers.

1. Extended abstracts: at least 2 and at most 4 pages; from these submissions, the PC chairs select papers in the scope of the call for presentation.
2. A full length draft (up to 16 pages), in Springer LNCS format, is required  to be submitted for accepted submissions before the Summer School. It will appear in the pre-proceedings.
3. At the summerschool each author will give a 20min presentation followed by a 10min discussion. The discussion will be started by an author of another paper by naming a strength, a weakness and a starting question for the discussion.
4. Before the second review phase, students have time to revise their papers, taking into account the comments they recieved and the discussion that took place at the Summer School. These revised, full papers are reviewed soon after the Summer School by Programme Committee members.

Based on these reviews, papers might be accepted, conditionally accepted, or rejected. Accepted and (after satisfactory revision) conditionally accepted papers will be included in the Summer School’s proceedings, which will be published by Springer.

In addition to research papers, the we also invite submissions for workshops and tutorials.

A workshop is an interactive session that is planned for one or two hours. In it, participants jointly work on a topic or project that is related to the theme of the summer school. Workshops actitivies are summarized in short papers that recapitulate the outcome and the kinds of discussion raised in the School, for inclusion in the post-proceedings. Proposals for workshops should contain a 2-page statement presenting the topic and summarising the planned activity and the expected contributions from the audience members, e.g. responding to a questionnaire or conducting a small experiment. Proposers should indicate whether any special equipment is needed for the workshop, such as audio-visual systems or computational equipment and support.

Tutorials are one or two hour long presentations. They should deal with topics that are of interest for the interdisciplinary audience in the summer school. They should provide knowledge on theoretical, empirical, methodological, practical or other aspects relevant for the summer school. Proposals should contain a 2-page summary and state the level and background required for audience members to follow the tutorial.

## Keynotes

**Os Keyes - Participation before Data: Historicising Trans Counterpower**
![](/assets/images/archive/2022/keynotes/os_keyes.png){: .align-left}

**Abstract:** In an era increasingly characterised by the hype around (and fear of) big data, notions of both participatory data practices and data counterpower are increasingly discussed. Both are valuable, but both are seen as relatively novel and untested. Are they? In this talk I will contextualise the idea of democratic data engagement and the use of data to "talk back" to those in power within the history of transgender ("trans") medicine. Demonstrating the long historic arc of these practices - an arc that starts before modern AI - I will discuss what lessons can be learned from the successes and failures of early digital trans activism.

**Os Keyes** ([Website](https://ironholds.org/)) is a researcher and writer at the University of Washington. Their work focuses on questions of gender, disability, technology and power, with a particular interest in machine learning, biomedicine and the intersection thereof. An inaugural Ada Lovelace Fellow, their work has been published in CSCW, CHI, *Cultural Studies* and a range of media venues, including *Vice, Wired* and *Logic* magazines.

**Dr. Welderufael B. Tesfay - Empowering end users’ privacy-related decision making with ML-enabled 
PETs**
![](/assets/images/archive/2022/keynotes/w_tesfay.jpg){: .align-left}

**Abstract:** Over the last decades, the advancement of the Internet and the digital services built on the Internet infrastructure have dramatically changed the way people interact with each other as well as the way they execute daily activities. This new dynamism forces users to generate large amounts of data. While such a huge amount of data is useful in a number of fields, such in medical research, it also poses unprecedented threats 
for user's privacy. In this talk, we will explore the application of machine learning techniques to build privacy preserving tools. Such tools empower the user in making informed-privacy related decisions, by also considering the user’s regulatory rights to privacy and informational self-determination.

**Welderufael** (aka Welde) is a Senior Researcher in information privacy and security at the Chair of Mobile Business & Multilateral Security at Goethe University Frankfurt am Main. He holds a Ph.D. degree in computer science from Goethe University Frankfurt, a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering with specialization in Mobile Systems from Luleå University of Technology, and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from  Mekelle Institute of Technology (MIT-Tigray). His research lays at the 'symbiosis' of user-centric approaches to information privacy protection, data protection regulations (e.g., the EU GDPR), and applied machine learning & NLP techniques. He endeavors to design and develop "intelligent" tools that empower the user in making informed privacy-related decisions regarding sensitive information disclosures by also taking the user’s regulatory rights into account. Additionally, since 2013, he has been working in various security and privacy related projects funded by the European Commission.

**Dr. des. Mary Shnayien - On privacy, (digital) media and reproductive rights in a post-Roe America**
![](/assets/images/archive/2022/keynotes/m_shnayien.jpg){: .align-left}

**Abstract:** On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States of America overruled Roe v. Wade, thereby ending the constitutional right to abortion. As Roe v. Wade was rooted in the right to privacy, its overturning sparked a discussion about whether anyone the state deems to be responsible for childbirth not only loses their right to have an abortion, but their right to privacy in a broader sense. My talk will contextualize these discussions in respect to the history of privacy and media, as well as examine viral advice on safeguarding one’s privacy online, such as deleting period tracking apps as means of protection against hostile legislation.

**Mary Shnayien** is a postdoctoral researcher associated with the Institute for Media Studies at Ruhr University Bochum and member of the DFG Research Network /Gender, Media and Affect/. She holds a PhD in media studies and comes from a background of theatre, media and gender studies. Her dissertation "Die unsicheren Kanäle. Negative und queere Sicherheit in Kryptologie und Informatik" will be published with /transcript/ this fall and focuses on the history and mediality of concepts of security in cryptology, IT security, and queer activism. Other research areas include digital cultures, economies, and infrastructures, as well as political affects and the intersections of media, gender, and race.

**Christian Buggedei - How to build organisations for privacy-friendly solutions**
![](/assets/images/archive/2022/keynotes/c_buggedei.png){: .align-left}

**Abstract:** One of the key challenges is to manage the different stakeholders: There Private citizens who don't want to have their privacy compromised. Then there are corporations that rely on access to that same data for their business models. And there is society, represented by governments and regulators, with their own overarching needs and interests.
polypoly has split up into three independent entities: A citizen-owned cooperative, a corporation, and a foundation.
Christian Buggedei explains the vision of polypoly and how this split ensures that everyones interests are fairly represented.

**Christian Buggedei** has more than 20 years of IT experience across all industries from the plumbing business around the corner to large public institutions. He is currently Product Owner at polypoly, a cooperative for all European citizens working on a new infrastructure for the data economy.
