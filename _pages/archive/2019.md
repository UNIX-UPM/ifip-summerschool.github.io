# Call for Papers

## Welcome to the IFIP Summers school
The 14th International IFIP Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management – Data for Better Living: AI and Privacy will take place on 19-23 August 2019 in Brugg/Windisch, Switzerland. The summer school is hosted by University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland.

## Holistic approach and interdisciplinarity
The IFIP Summer Schools take a holistic approach to society and technology and support interdisciplinary exchange through keynote and plenary lectures, tutorials, workshops, and research paper presentations. In particular, participants’ contributions that combine technical, legal, regulatory, socio-economic, social or societal, political, ethical, anthropological, philosophical, or psychological perspectives are welcome. The interdisciplinary character of the work is fundamental to the School.
