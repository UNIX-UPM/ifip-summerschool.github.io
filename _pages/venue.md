You can easily reach the building by metro (T-bane) via the station "Forskningsparken". Details can be found [here...](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/about/getting-around/index.html)

**Getting in**

Oslo has two airports, *Gardermoen (OSL)* and *Sandefjord (TRF)*, with the former being the most common way to reach the city. Both are easily connected to the city centre by bus and/or train. Alternatively, several ferries directly target the city, such as Color Line from Kiel in Germany, DFDS from Copenhagen in Denmark, or Stena Line from Frederikshavn in Denmark.

Within the city, the public metro system works very well, with the metro (T-Bane) operating frequently until late. The operator is called Ruter, see [https://ruter.no/en](https://ruter.no/en). Tickets can be purchased online, via the Ruter app, or at the vending machines at almost every metro station. What might be of special interest are the 24-hour and 7-day tickets, see [here](https://ruter.no/en/buying-tickets/tickets-and-fares/). Tickets are valid for zones, and within each zone, they are valid for all buses, trams, metro, and even local ferries (which can be a nice option to get a free harbour boat ride to the nearby islands).

**Accommodation**

As there are no hotels in reasonable proximity to the venue, we recommend to stay at one of the many hotels in the city centre. Recommended options are:

* [Clarion Hotel The Hub](https://www.strawberry.no/hotell/norge/oslo/clarion-hotel-the-hub/)
