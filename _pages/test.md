In the tutorial we present a primer understanding of general design patterns when it comes to private training of ML models, by drawing in research works from the state-of-the art private learning methods. We divide the tutorial into two parts, first the knowledge on the topic is introduced to the participants, which later is followed up through a hands-on exercise. </td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

Then we will explore the privacy challenges regarding the authentication and authorisation phase and potential solutions, including European Digital Identity. The session will be interactive, with participants working in groups to propose digital identity solutions to the privacy issues identified in the presentation (with compliance to the eIDAS framework ideally or other frameworks). This workshop is directed at a multidisciplinary audience, and participants from any field can be involved and give their contributions. </td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
