### Stefan Schiffner

**On the endeavour designing and deploying a privacy certification scheme under the GDPR**

[![PDF logo](/assets/images/pdficon.png "Keynote Slides")](/assets/slides/2023/KeynoteSchiffner.pdf)

**Abstract:** The talk will shortly sketch the genesis of a certification scheme. First, it will introduce the concept of GDPR certification under Art 42 /43 GDPR. Then it will reflect on the initial research challenges and the resulting research projects which lead to the development of lean sketch of a certification scheme. Some focus will be taken on the various technological obstacles on the way. The second half of the talk will then tell the story from finished research project to a scheme that can be used in practice; including, the legal and organisational inhibitors.

**The effacement of information technology from EU law: the need for collaborative approaches to redesign the EU’s regulatory architecture**

**Abstract:** EU information technology law is built like a multi-storey house: on the ground floor is technology development and on the top floor are regulatory principles and rights; in the middle floor lie standards, which should connect the top with the ground floor. The house is built on the premise that these floors are seamlessly connected, but are they? The multi-storey house was in fact built without staircases, causing a practical disconnect between regulatory principles and technology development. In this talk, which draws from the 2023 book ‘Cybersecurity, Privacy and Data Protection in EU law’, we will explore why information technology is effaced from EU law in practice, and the implications for cybersecurity, data protection, data markets, identity management, privacy and many other fields. We will explore what collaborative approaches may be needed to redesign the EU regulatory architecture.

### Lothar Fritsch

**The subtle differences between privacy risk and privacy breach consequences**  

**Abstract:** Handling personal data may cause risks for the persons whose data is processed or stored. But which risks are we referring to when we discuss privacy risks? Regulation sets specific emphasis on especially sensitive personal data, as well as on processing efforts that are affecting a large number of individuals, or society as a whole. Risk analysis in the form of data protection impact analysis (DPIA) and Privacy risk analysis (PRA) is required or strongly recommended in various frameworks. 
This talk will examine the concept of privacy risks and their consequences. It will present the various perspectives and what they actually capture, or neglect. Listeners will gain a better understanding on risks and consequences of personal data breaches, and about the maturity of the assessment methods used to assess such risks.

### Martin Degeling

**The Digital Services Act: New rules for online platforms and how to hold them accountable**

**Abstract:** The Digital Services Act is a legislative approach by the European Union to regulate (large) online platforms. It imposes a new set of roles regarding transparency, e.g. in content moderation or online advertising and mandates risk assessments and audits for those very large online platforms and search engines like Instagram, TikTok, Google or Zalando. They must assess the impact of their platforms, organizations and algorithms on systemic risks like election integrity or the mental health of its users.
In my talk, I will describe the idea of the DSA and its implications for researchers conducting studies on online platform data practices. I will draw examples from our research on TikTok and approaches to discuss methodologies for data-based platform research. 

**Martin Degeling** is a researcher at Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a berlin-based Think Tank for technology policy. Previously, he was a post-doctoral researcher at Ruhr-University Bochum and Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests are black-box auditing of algorithmic systems, usable privacy and security, and data protection.

### Jaap-Henk Hoepman 

**Privacy Is Hard And Seven Other Myths. Achieving Privacy Through Careful Design**

**Abstract:** In this talk Jaap-Henk Hoepman will discuss some of the myths
surrounding privacy (like "I have nothing to hide" and "We are not
collecting personal data" or "You have zero privacy anyway. Get over
it."). All to show that technological developments have had a tremendous
impact on our privacy, but also can be used to protect our privacy. He
will talk about the legal protection of privacy through the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), and discuss how relying on purely legal
measures is not enough. The systems themselves should be designed in a
privacy friendly manner, through privacy by design. He will explain the
privacy by design philosophy, and make it concrete by describing eight
privacy design strategies.

### Marit Hansen

**AI and Data Protection - Challenges for Controllers, Processors and Supervisory Authorities**

**Abstract:** In 2023, numerous artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as large language models and graphics software were made available to the public. Data protection regulators began investigating data processing related to some of these AI tools. At the same time, the legislative process on the European AI law continued. However, there are still some issues to be resolved in terms of promoting fair AI-powered data processing that impacts data subjects or society. In her talk, Marit explains data protection challenges for controllers, processors and supervisory authorities. She presents risks from the data protection perspective and beyond, and discusses potential steps to mitigate those risks.

**Deploying privacy enhancing technologies in an e-government**

**Abstract:** Would it not be amazing if a country could build data-driven services based on the data of its population or organisations while preserving the privacy of the individuals and providing transparency on the processing? In this talk we will take a look at the possibilities that different privacy enhancing technologies offer by enabling different stakeholders to process data without seeing individual values. We look at issues that public sector organisations have with using PETs and issues that could be solved by PETs.
